They can create portals to travel to their creations across the server or to their friends for quick trading or social interactions. All while keeping portals rather difficult to optain and maintain for new players, they become quiet cheap in the late game by the use of <code>Crying Obisdian</code>, <code>Ender Pearls</code> and <code>Upgrades</code>. This balances PortalShard to be a perfect fit for Survival Multiplayer Servers.</p>',5),i=[n];function s(l,c){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const m=e(r,[["render",s],["__file","index.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/portalshard/","title":"PortalShard - Home","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"dungeon","category":["Admin Documentation"],"tag":["software","spigot"],"star":true,"sticky":true,"article":false,"description":"PortalShard - Home Welcome to the documentation of my Minecraft Plugin PortalShard.
