# Administration Overview

> [!caution]
> This plugin is in **ALPHA**, please refrain from using it in a production environment!

Welcome to the Administrator Wiki for PortalShard!

This Wiki will provide you with information on how to install and configure the plugin. But first some general rules and proceedings you should follow:

  - Use a local test server
    - Check if the plugin is working on your current version
    - If possible, use a copy of your live server to check for any incompatibilities with other plugins you are using
  - Read **BOTH!** - the user and the administration wiki - before starting to use this plugin

## Support 

If you need help, found a bug or have a feature proposal/request, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Splitterlicht/PortalShard/issues)! Maybe further down the road there will be a support Discord or some sort of Service Desk.

If you donâ€™t want to create a GitHub account, you can send me a DM on Spigot MC or ask in the Discussions-Thread.
