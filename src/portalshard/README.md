# PortalShard - Home

![](https://oss.grafnus.de/assets/images/PortalShard.PNG =300x300)

Welcome to the documentation of my Minecraft Plugin PortalShard. The following chapters will show you all you need to know as a server owner/administrator to install and configure the plugin as well as all the features you can use as a player on the server.

## Summary

PortalShard is meant to add an immersive way for player to traverse large distances. 
They can create portals to travel to their creations across the server or to their friends for quick trading or social interactions. 
All while keeping portals rather difficult to optain and maintain for new players, 
they become quiet cheap in the late game by the use of `Crying Obisdian`, `Ender Pearls` and `Upgrades`. 
This balances PortalShard to be a perfect fit for Survival Multiplayer Servers.
